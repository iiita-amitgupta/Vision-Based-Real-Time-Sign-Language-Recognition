# Vision-Based-Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition


This Project is has 2 main components.
1. Hand Gesture Collection, Training the model and Predicting the gesture.
2. Model for ASL recognition.

For running these code we need to install TensorFlow, Keras, SKlearn, OpenCV, Anaconda-Navigator and Spyder in our System.

Component 1.
For dataset having six classes, to collect the data run collect-data.py, to train the model run train.py and to Predict the gesture using webcam of laptop, run predict.py .

Component 2.
For dataset having 29 classes, run train_29.py

These code can easily run on intel-i3 processor having 4GB RAM.
